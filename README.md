# Welcome to CityPop-app

- This app was developed as an assignment for WeKnowIt and my application to their student developer program.

- With this app you can enter a city to find out what the population of the city is. You can also search for country and recieve the three biggest cities of that country.

- To run the api you need to download the reposotory and install the dependencies.
- The project runs with NPM and Expo.

- You can easily use a simulator for both iOS and Android.

- I have found a couple of improvements to be done, some of which can be found in the comments.
